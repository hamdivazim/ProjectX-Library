This is a great beginner friendly project and is quite simple to make! All you will need is a large library of words (as a challenge try keeping these in a seperate text file!) and a robust Python program that can display the word with the gaps as underscores, and the infamous diagram of the stickman being hung as you lose more lives!\n\nCreate a file named `main.py` and create a list full of all the words you know; the more the better! Then, using the `random` module you can pick a random word from the list and show it to the user, remembering to not reveal it! Keep track of the letters the user has guessed correctly and keep track of the lives that remain too. As a challenge, try showing the stickman too via ASCII art! Good luck!"

      "content": "Creating a 3D platformer in C# with Unity can be an exciting and rewarding experience. In this article, we will walk you through the steps to develop your own 3D platformer game.\n\nFirst, you'll need to set up a new Unity project. Make sure you have the latest version of Unity installed on your computer. Create a new 3D project and set the project name and location. Once the project is created, you'll see the Unity editor interface.\n\nNext, you need to design and create your game's environment. This includes creating 3D models for the platforms, obstacles, and other elements. You can use Unity's built-in 3D modeling tools or import pre-made assets from the Unity Asset Store. Arrange the objects in your scene to create the desired level layout.\n\nTo add more complexity to your platformer, consider implementing different types of platforms such as moving platforms, disappearing platforms, or platforms with different physical properties. You can achieve this by scripting the behavior of these platforms or using Unity's physics engine to simulate their movements and interactions.\n\nOnce you have your environment set up, it's time to implement the platformer mechanics. First, create a script for the player character. Attach this script to the player object in your scene. In the script, you'll need to handle player movement using Unity's input system. Use the Rigidbody component to apply forces or velocities to the player object based on player input. You'll also need to handle jumping and collision detection to ensure the player can navigate the platforms.\n\nTo enhance the gameplay, you can add power-ups or collectibles for the player to collect. These can be implemented as additional game objects with specific scripts attached to them. When the player collides with a power-up or collectible, you can trigger certain effects or modify the player's abilities.\n\nFurthermore, you can introduce enemies or obstacles to add challenges to the gameplay. Create enemy characters with their own movement and behavior scripts. Implement logic for their interactions with the player, such as collision detection or shooting projectiles. This will require you to handle enemy AI and create engaging and dynamic encounters for the player.\n\nIn addition to the core gameplay mechanics, adding visual and audio effects can greatly enhance the player's experience. Implement sound effects and background music to create an immersive atmosphere. You can use Unity's Audio Source component to play sounds and adjust their properties. Consider adding particle effects for visual feedback and polish. For example, you can create particle systems for explosions, sparks, or collectible effects.\n\nTesting and iteration are crucial aspects of game development. Once you have implemented the core features of your 3D platformer, thoroughly test the game to ensure everything is working as intended. Test different scenarios, such as edge cases or challenging sections, to make sure the gameplay is balanced and enjoyable. Iterate on your design and mechanics based on the feedback you receive during testing.\n\nFinally, when you are satisfied with your game, it's time to build and publish it. Unity provides various platforms for publishing, such as PC, mobile devices, or consoles. Depending on your target platform, you'll need to configure the build settings and perform necessary optimizations. Pay attention to performance considerations and make sure your game runs smoothly on the target devices.\n\nCongratulations! You've now created a 3D platformer game in C# with Unity. From here, you can continue adding more levels, implementing new mechanics, and refining the gameplay. Enjoy the process of game development and keep experimenting with new ideas to create even more exciting games. With dedication and perseverance, you can create memorable experiences for players to enjoy.\n\nRemember that game development is a continuous learning process. Take advantage of the vast resources available online, such as tutorials, documentation, and community forums. Engage with the Unity community and learn from other developers. Share your work, seek feedback, and collaborate with others to improve your skills.\n\nAs you progress in your game development journey, consider exploring advanced topics such as optimization techniques, level design principles, and multiplayer functionality. These will allow you to take your 3D platformer game to the next level and create a truly immersive and engaging experience.\n\nAdditionally, don't forget the importance of game design principles. Pay attention to factors like level progression, difficulty curve, and player engagement. Strive to create a balanced and enjoyable experience for your players.\n\nLastly, have fun with your game development journey. Building a 3D platformer in C# with Unity is not only a technical process but also a creative one. Let your imagination soar and experiment with different ideas. Embrace the challenges that come along the way and celebrate your successes.\n\nNow, armed with the knowledge and guidance from this article, it's time to dive into the world of 3D platformer game development. Good luck, and may your game be a thrilling adventure for players around the globe!"
